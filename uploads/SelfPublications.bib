	how does one know which information is relevant and which is fake,
	for making the foundation of decisions? Here comes the role of provenance.
	In this paper, the characteristics of a data such as why, when, where,
	what, how, and who are determined using PROV family of documents,
	giving full structural format to data and determining all its characteristics
	and its existential source. Now all this provenance information describing
	all aspects of data when connected will generate a footprint. Apache
	NiFi has been used to show the flow of data and its manipulation.
	The digital footprint as it is all in digital format can be traceable
	to determine data trustworthiness, i.e., its provenance, hence determining
	the reliability of an organization for merger, acquisition, data
	analysis, stock market, etc.},

  journal = {Information Sciences},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {492},
  pages = {147 - 163},
  abstract = {Query expansion (QE) is a well-known technique used to enhance the
	effectiveness of information retrieval. QE reformulates the initial
	query by adding similar terms that help in retrieving more relevant
	results. Several approaches have been proposed in literature producing
	quite favorable results, but they are not evenly favorable for all
	types of queries (individual and phrase queries). One of the main
	reasons for this is the use of the same kind of data sources and
	weighting scheme while expanding both the individual and the phrase
	query terms. As a result, the holistic relationship among the query
	terms is not well captured or scored. To address this issue, we have
	presented a new approach for QE using Wikipedia and WordNet as data
	sources. Specifically, Wikipedia gives rich expansion terms for phrase
	terms, while WordNet does the same for individual terms. We have
	also proposed novel weighting schemes for expansion terms: in-link
	score (for terms extracted from Wikipedia) and a tf-idf based scheme
	(for terms extracted from WordNet). In the proposed Wikipedia-WordNet-based
	QE technique (WWQE), we weigh the expansion terms twice: first, they
	are scored by the weighting scheme individually, and then, the weighting
	scheme scores the selected expansion terms concerning the entire
	query using correlation score. The proposed approach gains improvements
	of 24% on the MAP score and 48% on the GMAP score over unexpanded
	queries on the FIRE dataset. Experimental results achieve a significant
	improvement over individual expansion and other related state-of-the-art
	approaches. We also analyzed the effect on retrieval effectiveness
	of the proposed technique by varying the number of expansion terms.},

	aims to identify and eliminate rogue taxa to produce more informative
	consensus trees. Given a collection of phylogenetic trees over the

	the number of internal edges in the consensus tree of the collection.
	We show that this problem is NP-hard for strict and majority-rule

	consensus when the maximum degree of the strict consensus of the
	original trees is bounded. We describe exact integer linear programming

  abstract = {The problem of mining collections of trees to identify common patterns,
	called frequent subtrees (FSTs), arises often when trying to interpret
	the results of phylogenetic analysis. FST mining generalizes the
	well-known maximum agreement subtree problem. Here we present EvoMiner,
	a new algorithm for mining frequent subtrees in collections of phylogenetic
	trees. EvoMiner is an Apriori-like levelwise method, which uses a
	novel phylogeny-specific constant-time candidate generation scheme,
	an efficient fingerprinting-based technique for downward closure,
	and a lowest-common-ancestor-based support counting step that requires
	neither costly subtree operations nor database traversal. Our algorithm
	achieves speedups of up to 100 times or more over Phylominer, the
	current state-of-the-art algorithm for mining phylogenetic trees.
	EvoMiner can also work in depth-first enumeration mode to use less
	memory at the expense of speed. We demonstrate the utility of FST
	mining as a way to extract meaningful phylogenetic information from
	collections of trees when compared to maximum agreement subtrees
	and majority-rule trees---two commonly used approaches in phylogenetic
	analysis for extracting consensus information from a collection of

	of millions of online shoppers that are part of an online retail
	industry worth of hundreds of billions of dollars. While online shopping
	has its own advantages (such as convenience, product reviews, price
	and selection range), recent focus has been in using technology to
	mimic the social interactions found in physical shopping malls and
	stores in what is called as �social shopping�. Put simply, in social
	shopping shoppers� friends become involved in the shopping experience.
	An important aspect of social shopping is �co-shopping� where ad-hoc
	collaborative shopping groups are formed in which one person can
	drive an online shopping experience for one or more other people.
	This requires a mechanism that provisions multiple users to conduct
	real time online shopping collaboratively from multiple locations.
	For example, family members at remote locations can view the product
	online simultaneously as if they are shopping together in real time.
	To this end we have designed a special collaborative browsing window
	in which all the co-shoppers need to login. One user becomes the
	leader and invites others from his friends� list for shopping. Other
	users need to accept this invitation and join the shopping. The leader
	upon liking a product initiates the co-shopping by clicking on �Share
	this product with selected friends� button. On clicking this button
	an AJAX request, which contains URL of the product and list of IDs
	of selected friends, goes to the server. The server receives the
	URL of the product and list of IDs of friends and pushes this URL
	to all the selected friends in an asynchronous manner using PUSH
	AJAX technology. This URL gets loaded into an HTML iFrame on every
	client's browsing window. Shoppers can communicate with each other
